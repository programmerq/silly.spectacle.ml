# Silly Spectacles

##When The World Got Too Real

###Verse 1

You were young then so why did you let the memories pass?

You thought he would be there in the morning

When the world got too real

He was such a nice guy it was all you had

You were young then so why did you let the memories pass?

You had no idea of what love was


###Chorus

Unless you had him on your radar

Until he told you it was love at first sight

He couldn't believe your lucky eyes

He said you were holding a place that you had never been


###Verse 2

Until he told you it was love at first sight

And he was young then so why did you let the memories pass?

You thought he would be there in the morning

When the world got too real

He was such a nice guy it was all you had

He was such a nice guy it was all you had


###Chorus

Unless you had him on your radar

Until he told you it was love at first sight

He couldn't believe your lucky eyes

He said you were holding a place that you had never been
